            <p class="no-indent"><span class="opener type-xl line-solid">它</span>開始是一道裂痕，其餘的一切從其中竄出，就像蒸汽：一縷顫搖的細線將空間割出凹凸不整的邊，虛空碎裂，化成粒粒腐敗的輕子與夸克的鋒利破片，它們就像微波爐裡的生雞蛋一樣爆開來。在次原子層級、由下而上、由內而外地，漸漸地消逝了。在宏觀面上，它看起來像風暴的風眼－－超巨大的黑洞，其寬度延伸至永恆。它將無限的意象變得如玻璃紙般微薄而脆弱；撕碎每個維度，一張兩端被掐住的紙，一個戳穿它的洞。</p>
            <p>在洞的中央，可以聽到邊緣在磨融的聲音。群魔亂舞，連續性在中間發生了形變而兩個尾端一塊撞了個粉碎。在洞的周圍，群鬼哭號。他們用指甲剝落的絕望緊箝著他們正死去的夢的邊緣，他們全像風一樣地刮著，尾隨著的是他們想像中的未來解離成的殘破光點。這是上古結局的多層次碎形霓虹氣旋，超終結翻騰攪拌機、災難性的終點，壓倒性的永久雙倍死亡。隨著尖叫聲愈靠近窟窿它開始扭曲然後沉落。</p>
            <p>在中央，那扭曲轉變成了令人不安的怪異音樂。那是嘈雜的終點－－那些破滅、那些尖叫、那些噗嗤的聲響、那基本粒子像長條起司推進攪肉機一樣被輾碎的聲響，都倒放進了一個奇怪地樂聲悠揚的垃圾絞碎機。一切都解決到一個主導的調性上，配合著音高和曲調，化解那些叛逆的升與降，直到不和諧音變得纖弱。一個只能在骨肉裡聽到的次調和交響樂。在事件的<em>正中心</em>，那是極度地安靜的，無限恆常之中的所有苦難構成沉默，它們一同流著血，直到將稜鏡染成黑耀石。它過於龐大，難以理解；過於黑暗，以至於不閉眼難以凝視。撤退回自己的眼皮底下尋求那熟悉的黑暗吧。這是為了抗拒那完美迥異於人類的那純粹的黑與玄的威脅，它要把人性從你的眼袋進直直扯出來。</p>
            <p>這是萬物的終點。這是悖論空間的終點。你... </p>
            <p class="Command">&gt; 醒來。</p>
            <p class="no-indent">你的名字是John Egbert，你剛才做了一個很糟的、強烈地矯揉造作的惡夢。你閃身掉下了床，全身浸滿汗水，你的心跳像火災警報器一樣陣陣作響，這正是你害怕的事情。</p>
            <p>You’ve been dreaming in anime again. And you have no idea what it could mean.</p>
            <p class="Command">&gt; Look outside just to make absolutely sure the world is not ending.</p>
            <p>The sun is coming in through your window in bars of soft yellow. The only sound you can hear for miles is the wind skimming the hollows of your neighbors’ pipe homes. It’s a normal day in the salamander village, which you refer to as Salamander Village because the damned salamanders never bothered to give this village a name, you guess. Absolutely nothing of note has ever happened here in the entire history of the planet, which you would know, because you created it.</p>
            <p>Beside your pillow, your phone is vibrating. Rose is calling. The screen of your phone reads 9:30 a.m. April 13, and also the number forty-six, which is how many text messages your friend left you while you were sleeping. A bit excessive, even for her.</p>
            <p class="Command">&gt; Answer the phone.</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Since when are you known to operate your telephone?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: since... i don’t know. has it really been that long since i called?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I can’t remember the last time. </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: neither can i. anyway, what’s up?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: First of all, happy birthday. </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: oh, yeah. thanks.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: fuck, i forgot.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Am I correct in presuming this April Thirteenth will be as uneventful as the last?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: yeah, i don’t want to do anything this year. i hope that’s ok.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Of course it’s ok. It’s your birthday after all.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: Rose...</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes?</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">You wander to the window and watch the salamanders go about their day. All over the neighborhood, the little dad-salamanders are putting on their little rumpled hats and picking up their little suitcases and kissing their little families goodbye for the day. You’ve always been confused about what, exactly, they contribute to the global economy. But it’s pretty cute how much they love playing at being suburban businessmen. </p>
            <p class="no-indent">The silence over the phone is growing awkward. You’ve stalled long enough. You decide to just come out and say it.</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: i’ve been dreaming in anime again lately.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: i have no idea what it could mean.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I see.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: it’s horrible, every time.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: and i don’t mean because anime is bad or anything. it’s not that.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: whenever i have these dreams, everything’s breaking apart.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: millions of people are screaming and dying.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: i mean, dying permanently. not the kind of bullshit dying that we’ve been doing a lot over the years.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">A couple yards over, a salamander blows an astounding spit bubble. Truly one for the books. Your eyes trace its meandering journey into the sky as you gather your thoughts.</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: what do you think it all means?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: What do I think ‘what’ means?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: what do you think it means that i’ve been dreaming in anime?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I don’t have the slightest idea what it means that you’ve been dreaming in anime, John. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: To be honest, I... </p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">You wait for Rose to finish her thought. She doesn’t, which is troubling because you have never known Rose to leave a thought unfinished in over ten years of acquaintance. You suppose it’s possible it may have happened one of the times she died. You wouldn’t bet on it though.</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: rose... are you ok?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Not exactly.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: what’s wrong?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I think my condition’s been getting worse lately.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: condition?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s why my message probably sounded urgent.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: you left 46 messages.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes. They were all urgent.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: oh.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I don’t think I can wait much longer before telling you.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I held out for as long as I could. I figured your birthday was as good a time as any to let you know.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: let me know what?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s crept up on me, these last couple of years.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Gradually enough to ignore as it was happening, but I can’t anymore.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Lately the visions have been overwhelming.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: visions??</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: John, I have terrible headaches these days. Talking on the phone doesn’t help at all.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Would you mind flying to my apartment, so we can continue this in person?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: oh, yeah. you mean...</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: now?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes, now is the time.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I’ve put it off long enough.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">You move the phone away from your ear and assume an expression you haven’t practiced in years. It is the look of a man who actually has something to do. Holding the phone directly in front of your face, you speak into the receiver. </p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: ok, i’m on my way. bye, rose.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">As you hang up the phone, a familiar feeling settles over you. A feeling of...standing? Standing, and being alone. In your bedroom. As a young man. On your birthday. You swear you’ve felt this feeling before. It’s almost like... </p>
            <p class="Normal ParaOverride-7"><span class="Standard-Text">A young man stands alone in his bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 13th of April, is this young man’s birthday. Though it was twenty-three years ago when he was given life, and ten years ago when he was given a name, it feels like it is only today that he will begin to understand what all that means.</span></p>
            <p class="Normal ParaOverride-7"><span class="Standard-Text">That young man is YOU, John Egbert.</span></p>
