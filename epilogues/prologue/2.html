            <p class="no-indent"><span class="opener">當</span>你抵達Rose的公寓，你發現她睡在沙發上。悄悄地，你將陽台門滑開。</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: rose？</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">她的眼睛拍翅地睜開。她的臉色似鬼，而且不是那種長相與行為完全都和活人一樣的鬼。</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 我...我睡多久了？</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 不知道，我才剛到。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 你還好嗎？</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 我會好的。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 你藥看起來吃了很多喔。</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 沒錯。但這不是你想的那樣。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 我想的怎樣？</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 這些是由合格的醫生所開的管制藥物，來減緩我生病的症狀。我只是依照指示服藥。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 好哦？？</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 所以沒有什麼好擔心的。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 但你說你生病了。這是不是...不好嗎？</p>
            </div>
              <p class="no-indent">你看著她分階段地坐起。她的手臂顫抖著，支撐在沙發上。</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 喔，是。病情本身是不樂觀，蠻明顯的。或許在不同的對話主題下這可以認作是需要擔心的事情。但我要講的就只是，我沒有重犯舊癮，如果你顧慮的是這點。</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">作為回應，你花了幾些時間意味深長地什麼也不說。你打量Rose在沙發上仰臥、徐緩的體態，樂觀的是，她會把話繼續說下去。</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 我和藥物濫用纏鬥過一段日子，幾年前的事了。記得嗎？</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: rose，老天。我沒有要說你的藥癮，我飛過來也不是來幫你諮商的。/p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 因為你聽起來有重要的事要跟我說，加上你看起來生病的樣子讓我有點太驚恐了！</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 我不會說是生病。</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 這只是特別令人衰弱的頭痛，最近畫面變得愈來愈頻繁造成的。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 喔對。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 你的那些畫面是什麼啊？</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: John，我是光明之先知。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 我知道。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 所以你指的是，你的正常的未來預視畫面之類的？</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 有什麼事要發生了嗎？我們需要擔心嗎？</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 技術上來說這與未來無關。至少，與我們的未來無關。</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 我的能力現在已經大幅度的增廣，超越了它先前的界限。它們把光照在許多看不見的事件上。在過去、現在、未來，在與我們的時空與參考系從不相干涉的地方。</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 這看來是神化能力的不幸的副作用之一。它們進步的速率會超過一個人的身體能力所能趕上的。</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 幸運的是看來除了我之外沒有人遇到這樣的情況。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 是啊，我是沒有注意到過什麼類似的事。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 就我的力量方面也沒有。</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 這不是獲得額外能力的關係，儘管那多到像你的意識和消逝在其他時間線中的許多命定人格逐漸溶解在一起。</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 這是緩慢且明顯十分令人不適的知識積累。或許我是唯一一位注意到有變化的吧，我的向度(aspect)是直接與知識相關的。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 我想這很合理。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 所以你都從畫面看到了什麼？</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 很多事情。它們是很不連貫的，有時很難編排成一致的情節。</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 但總的來說，就目前的狀況以及將我們引導至這個狀況的所有事件，我已經組織了一個較為宏觀的理解。</p>
            </div>
              <p class="no-indent">你看著Rose拖著腳移動到她公寓的旁一邊。在小廚房裡，她用熟練的動作又吞下一顆藥丸，不配水。她靜靜等待著藥效發作，同時空洞的凝視在流理檯上鑽洞。</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: ……然後？</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 然後什麼？</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 你想告訴我的關於我們狀況的事情？</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 是壞事嗎？</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 好與壞是沒有任何意義的詞彙，在跨過了凡人的思考的某個門檻之後。</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 我最終理解了一個不一樣的度量。一個更不……我猜是更不情緒化的二分法？</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 考慮，不用「好」，而用「必要」。</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 而與必要的相對的極端是……</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 某些最好不去深思的東西。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 你在說什麼？</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 聽起來是有問題了。</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 是的，這聽起來就像是你對我所述說的事會有的反應。</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 我真應該先停了，直接從最開始說起吧。</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">你跟著Rose到陽台上。她舉起一隻手直直地比向清澈的藍天。她是有意所指，好似在說，<span class="Standard-Text CharOverride-14">在那兒</span><span class="Standard-Text">。就在那兒，那準確的點上，是綠太陽的位置，如果它還存在的話。</span></p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 綠太陽消失了。</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: 什麼？？</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: 它被催毀了。至少在當前參考系中已經如此。</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: It still existed, and therefore in a way that’s hard to explain, currently exists, over a nearly infinite span of time, presiding over the birth and death of countless universes.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: But this universe, our universe, is not one of them.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: you saw this in a vision?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: No. Jade told me.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: she did?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: how does she know?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: She can’t draw from its power anymore. She no longer has the ability of a First Guardian.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: It has been this way for several years. I suspect she has kept this fact on the downlow, however.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: that’s... </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: surprising, i guess?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: or maybe not. i dunno, it’s not like she tells me a whole lot these days.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s also not like she’s had any particular need to unleash the full fury of the green sun, not while she’s been gallivanting around with Dave and Karkat under whatever perplexing social arrangement they have settled on.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Anyway, her account of the sun’s destruction syncs up with the data supplied by my visions. I have no doubt it’s gone.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: how did that happen?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: It doesn’t matter much, for our purposes.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: There was a cataclysmic event. A suicide strike by a very powerful being. Much like the one Dave and I attempted, once upon a time.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: But it turned out the explosive force we released was only a catalyst. A causal gesture. What was needed to destroy the sun was a consumptive assault.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: consumptive?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: The entire sun was swallowed by a supermassive black hole. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I digress though. </p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">You press your eyes shut, just for a moment. Behind them you see <em>a black hole so supermassive that it spans the width of eternity.</em></p>
            <p>You quickly open your eyes again, and pretend to forget what you just saw. </p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="rose">ROSE: There’s really no route through this expository garden path that will adequately cushion you from the bottom line, John.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: You will need to travel back into canon and defeat Lord English.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">You... </p>
            <p class="Command">&gt; Shrug and try to look casual.</p>
            <p class="no-indent">You pull off the most casual shrug that a guy has ever shrugged when being presented with the inevitability of his own fate. If Rose were looking at you right now, she would be totally convinced that you are approaching this topic with a level of nonchalance that is entirely plausible and genuine. You’re sure of it. </p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: yeah, i had a feeling that was going to come up again someday.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m sure we all did. That is, even those of us without visions.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: i was doing my best not to think about it. i guess we can’t put it off any longer then?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Now is the time. We are rapidly approaching a point of no return. If the decision isn’t made soon, it will be too late. The issue will no longer matter.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: when exactly is the point of no return?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Today.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: wow. </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: ok then.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: first, one question. um...</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: why?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Why what?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: why do i need to go back and beat him?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: i mean, sorry if this is a stupid question. i guess he’s a huge awful monster, and that’s just what you’re supposed to do with huge awful monsters. take them down for their crimes, and such.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: but why does he actually need to be defeated at all? to be honest, it’s been years since we’ve even bothered thinking about any of this, and everything seems... </p>
            </div>
            <p class="Command">&gt; Take a look around and survey the current status of all life on Earth, which is totally possible to do from the vantage point of a single apartment balcony. </p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: fine?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Of course everything is fine here.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: We’re outside of canon now.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: yeah, i know. what does that actually MEAN though?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: are you saying this isn’t really happening?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Of course it’s happening. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Just because certain events take place outside of canon, it doesn’t mean those events are non-canon.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: oh.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: In other words, there is an important distinction between events which can be considered to occur inside canon, outside canon, and those which are not canon at all.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: The day we went through that door and claimed our reward, we passed a threshold between continua marked by differing degrees of relevance, truth, and essentiality. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Those are the three pillars of canon.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: what?</p>
            </div>
              <p class="no-indent">Rose shoots you an irritated look. You know what that look means. It’s reserved for the sort of bozo who just said “what” once too often. </p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Any event said to take place inside canon will have nonzero values of relevance and essentiality, while maintaining an absolute foundation in truth, by definition.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Whereas events outside canon have diminished values of relevance and essentiality. Or, for the most part, can be considered neither relevant nor essential at all. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: But such events can’t be said to be untrue either. Instead, it’s better to regard their truth value as highly conditional. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Are you still following?</p>
            </div>
            <p class="Command">&gt; Say “oh, yeah. totally.”</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: oh, yeah. totally.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: So to be clear, everything that’s taken place here on Earth C since we exited canon can be considered completely irrelevant, and for the most part, absolutely inessential. Yet none of it can be called untrue. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: At least, up until precisely today. </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: ok.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: then what does non-canon mean?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Events that are formally non-canon have no truth whatsoever, by definition. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: They may have relevance and essentiality values that are nonzero, or even quite high, but only as projections along an imaginary axis, resulting from highly subjective frames of reference.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: But due to those events having no truth, and thus carrying no real weight, the other properties are basically rendered meaningless.</p>
            </div>
              <p>You can feel your eyes go wide as the gears in your head slow to a stop. The implications of what Rose is saying are as vast as they are completely incomprehensible. Your mind has just been BLOWN.</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="rose">ROSE: John?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Are you okay? Your pupils have gone quite wide, thereby facilitating the appearance that your mind has just been blown.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: sorry, i’m just trying to wrap my head around this.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: You of all people really should have a good intuitive grasp over these concepts already. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: You’re the one with the retcon powers, after all.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: i know!</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: like, i mostly get it. i think.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: i just wouldn’t have thought to put all of this in such a jargony way.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Sorry. That’s kind of what I do.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: it’s fine. i’m just a bit rusty is all. </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: it feels like it’s been so long since i did, or even thought about... anything that mattered at all.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes, the longer we live outside of canon, the more tenuous our relationship with canon becomes.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Hence the urgency.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: then what’s going to happen if we keep dragging our feet?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I mentioned that events outside canon have a truth value that tends to be conditional, remember?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: um.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Well, I did. But let me put it another way.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: As long as we live outside canon, everything that happens will technically be “real,” but only conditionally. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: There are certain crucial events inside canon which must happen in order to continue to prop up the legitimacy of events here on Earth C. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: And you specifically, John, have a responsibility to make sure those events take place.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: and i take it that means going back and killing lord english?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: His defeat is the keystone to this entire continuity. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Much like his life, in some sick way, governed the overall design of the bridge which that keystone was holding up.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: But without it, all of this falls apart. Every thing we’ve been through, in a way that’s impossible for a single mind to fully comprehend, becomes retroactively discredited. </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: so... reality will be destroyed, or something?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: hasn’t that already sort of happened?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: i mean, when all the black space started cracking?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: No, this consequence isn’t physical, or even a disruption of the timeline. It’s more of a conceptual unraveling.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: If you miss the chance to authenticate canon events, something will take place that’s a bit difficult to describe, but I’ve encountered a term for it.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s called “dissipation.”</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Like, a notional fading. As if something, somewhere, is undergoing a process of “forgetting,” and we are what is being forgotten.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: All ideas, people and their full potentialities, possible outcomes and their specific unfolding, all these things live inside conscious frameworks. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: The further removed we get from authentication of canon events, the less relevant they become, and they slowly fade from the conscious frameworks which kept them stable.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="Command">&gt; Make a theatrically startled expression.</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: ok, i guess we don’t want THAT to happen.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: or... unhappen. whatever.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: so i just retcon-poof back to english and start like...</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: brawling with the dude?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Don’t be ridiculous. You wouldn’t last a second.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: You’ll need a team.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Also, you don’t want to just dive headlong into a battle with his hulking adult form. That would be tactically foolish, and furthermore, would skip over some very important steps needed to authenticate canon.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: like what?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I mentioned that English’s defeat was the keystone to the continuity. But this is an oversimplification.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: yikes. well, we sure as fuck wouldn’t want to simplify anything.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: John, please don’t be a bitch. I’m unwell, remember?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: sorry.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: The true keystone, which is a necessary component of his defeat, is the juju.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: The house-shaped object you stuck your hand in to gain your retcon powers.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: oh yeah.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: While empty, it resembles a gap. Like a hole in canon, whose only purpose is to be filled.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: In serving that purpose, it grants one with the radical canon-altering powers that would be needed to fill it.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Once filled, it becomes solid. No longer a gap, but a serviceable, load-bearing wedge in our continuity.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Like a keystone.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: And once delivered to English and directed his way, it empties itself again, releasing its narrative-bridging payload. It functions as a weapon, and in some manner will bring about his demise.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: in some manner?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s a complicated artifact. As old and unfathomable as anything else in Paradox Space, like the green sun, or English himself. Don’t worry about it for now.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: The important thing is that, in the due course of your travels, you end up loading and unloading this weapon.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: how am i going to do that?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Once you set things in motion, it should just happen naturally through the narrative momentum of your journey. I’m really just warning you about it, rather than instructing you.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: ok. thanks??</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: You’re welcome.</p>
            </div>
              <p class="no-indent">Rose looks at her phone. You recognize Kanaya’s distinct typing style in the window. Rose’s thumbs begin to fly across the keypad. She continues to text as she talks.</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: so if we’re going to go back and kill him in time to “authenticate canon,” i guess we have to get going soon.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: like today?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: are you sure you’re actually up for a fight though? no offense, but you’re looking a little worse for the wear.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m not going.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: oh.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: None of us are. Only you.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: what?? but you said... </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: John, this is the victory state. </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: what the hell does that even mean.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: When we went through the door, and passed beyond the threshold of canon, we effectively retired from bearing any responsibility for influencing canon events. We’ve all been sort of decommissioned as active players on the cosmic stage, with severely diminished relevance attributes. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: All of us except for you, of course, since you’ve retained your retcon abilities.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: ok, i get that. kind of. </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: but... couldn’t you all just come along anyway?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: We could. But it wouldn’t serve any purpose.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: It wouldn’t plug up the remaining dark spots in canon. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: You’ll need a group of active players. Those still stuck inside the stream of canonic karma.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: who?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Nothing too extravagant. Just different versions of us. </p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Younger versions, from a particularly dysfunctional impasse in our journey.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I can point out the exact moment in canon you should be disrupting, and how you should disrupt it.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: In fact, I’ve already written it down to spare you the trouble of remembering.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">Rose leads you back inside and retrieves a letter from her desk. She hands it over, still typing one-handed on her phone. She sits down and you read the letter.</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: huh.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Is anything confusing about my instructions?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: no, i remember all this. it shouldn’t be a problem. </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: it’s just weird to think about revisiting this. it seems like an eternity. like... we were all completely different people back then.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I assure you we are all still fundamentally the same bunch of losers.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">Rose is ultimately right about that, the way she is about most things. You continue to scan the letter, and grimace slightly.</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: should i really punch her in the face?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: i felt kinda bad about it, last time i did that to someone.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes. You absolutely should, and must, punch her in the face.</p>
            </div>
              <p class="no-indent">You exhale and turn the paper over in your hands. The other side is blank. You flip it back over, having fully processed the instructions drafted in the polished purple handwriting. You like how Rose still writes in purple, after all these years. Some things never change.</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: alright. this seems straightforward enough.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: i mean, aside from the part where we all have to fight an invincible monster.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: He isn’t entirely invincible. He will be vulnerable to Dave’s weapon. I believe other gambits should present themselves as well.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: I don’t think it would serve the mission well for me to tell you exactly how it will go.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: But at least I can offer this bit of encouragement.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: If you follow my instructions, English will be defeated.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: It is an absolutely essential outcome.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: And essential, if you’ll remember, is the word we should be using instead of good.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: i see you’re advising we go after him when he’s young...  </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: i guess that makes sense.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: go get him before he gets all big and strong.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: like, kind of a surprise attack?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Sure.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: that dude sucks. </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: he was taunting me a while back. </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: like, i think he WANTS me to come fight him?</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: anyway, i just ignored him obviously, because i’m not a stupid idiot.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: but i guess today will be his lucky day.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">You take a seat next to Rose on the couch.</p>
            <p class="Command">&gt; Examine your friend.</p>
            <p class="no-indent">Her eyes are closed and her hands are folded in her lap. She’s not asleep, but she looks wasted—like all the life in her has been sucked out through a straw. Like she’s insubstantial. When you were kids you always thought that Rose Lalonde had all the answers, that she could fix any problem with a wall of text and a witty rejoinder. You guess that much about her hasn’t changed. She’s still trying to solve the problems you all left behind. You can’t believe how sick she looks. How did this happen to her?</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: i should probably get going and let you rest.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: we can talk all about it when i get back. i’ll fill you in on how it went, hopefully you’ll be feeling better by then.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Oh. Um.</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Yeah.</p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: is something wrong?</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">Rose opens her eyes and looks at you, but she says nothing. Just looks.</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="john">JOHN: i’m not scared, if that’s what you’re worried about. </p>
              <p class="john">JOHN: you already said we’re going to defeat him. so, nothing to fret over, right?</p>
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes. You...  </p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">Something flickers through her eyes, almost too quick to catch. When she smiles at you, it’s warm and sincere.</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="rose">ROSE: You’re going to do great.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">Rose slides her arms around you. After a while, she releases you from the embrace and gets up to fetch her bottle of pills. She pauses at the bedroom door to look at you one more time.</p>
            <div class="chat">
              <p class="rose">ROSE: Goodbye, John.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="no-indent">She closes the door behind her.</p>
            <p class="Command">&gt; Look at the letter.</p>
            <p class="no-indent">Your run your thumbs along the edge of the paper. Is this really it? One hug from Rose and you’re off to face your destiny? The instructions in the letter are clear, but you aren’t sure precisely what to do next. Inertia and indecision keep your feet planted firmly on the carpet.</p>
            <p>Then, as if directly answering your quandary, your phone buzzes in your pocket. It’s a text from Roxy.</p>
            <p class="Command">&gt; Read text.</p>
            <p class="no-indent">It sounds important. You get up to go without even thinking about it. You exit through the sliding glass door and leave it open behind you. </p>
